# Contributing to my-package

This guide is for everyone who changes my-package, people and coding agents
alike. Agents also follow [For coding agents](#for-coding-agents) at the end.

## Setup

my-package uses [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev) for tools, tasks and env vars, so
a task runs the same locally and in CI.

```bash
mise run setup:dev   # installs Python 3.13 + uv, syncs deps, installs pre-commit hooks
mise run test        # tests
mise run ci          # everything CI runs: lint, typecheck, tests, wheel check
```

`mise tasks` lists every task. The pre-commit hooks run `ruff check --fix` and
`ruff format` on staged Python files; `mise run lint:fix` does the same for the
whole tree.

## Workflow

1. Branch from an up-to-date `main` (see [Branches](#branches)).
2. Write a failing test first, then make it pass.
3. Update the docs in the same PR when user-visible behaviour changes
   (`docs/user/`, and `README.md` if the quick start changes). The
   [developer guide](docs/developer/guide.md#docs) says which page covers what.
4. Run `mise run ci` until it passes.
5. Open a PR with a [Conventional Commit title](#pr-titles-and-commits) and
   fill in the template.
6. Squash-merge once all three CI checks (Linux, macOS, Windows) are green.

Keep each PR to one concern. A refactor that a fix needs goes in its own PR
first.

## Branches

Name branches `<type>/<short-description>`, lowercase kebab-case:

```
feat/config-file
fix/empty-input-crash
docs/install-windows
```

| Type       | Use for                                                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | New behaviour users can see                              |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                                |
| `docs`     | Docs only (`README.md`, `docs/`, this file, `CLAUDE.md`) |
| `test`     | Tests only, no behaviour change                          |
| `refactor` | Code change with no behaviour change                     |
| `perf`     | A speed or memory improvement                            |
| `build`    | Packaging, dependencies, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`     |
| `ci`       | Workflows, `.mise/tasks`, hooks, repo settings           |
| `chore`    | Anything else, including release version bumps          |

Release branches are the exception: `release/vX.Y.Z`, made by
`mise run release:prepare` (see [Releasing](#releasing)).

`main` is protected: changes land only through a PR with green checks.
Branches are deleted automatically after merge.

## PR titles and commits

`main` is squash-merged and the commit title is the PR title, so the PR
title is what history keeps. Write it as a
[Conventional Commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org):

```
<type>(<optional scope>): <imperative summary, lowercase, no full stop>

feat(cli): add --dry-run
fix: return None for a missing key
feat(config)!: rename output_dir to output.dir
```

- The type matches the branch type.
- Scope is optional: a module or area.
- `!` after the type or scope marks a breaking change. Explain the break and
  the migration in the PR body.

Commits on the branch are squashed, so their messages are free-form. Keep
them readable for reviewers.

## Tests

- **Unit** (`tests/unit`, `mise run test:unit`): one module's behaviour, in
  process. Add other suites as sibling folders with their own
  `.mise/tasks/test/<suite>` task and list them in `test/_default`.
- Every bug fix comes with a regression test that fails without the fix.
- A test that hangs is killed by `pytest-timeout`, with every thread's stack
  dumped at 60 s. Read that dump before retrying.

## Code

- Match the style of the code around you: naming, comment density, idiom.
- Comments explain why, not what.
- `ruff` (lint + format) and `ty` (types) must pass; `mise run ci` runs both.
- Pin GitHub Actions to a full commit SHA with a version comment.
  Dependabot keeps actions and `uv` dependencies current.

## Releasing

my-package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org). While it is
0.x, a breaking change bumps the minor version, everything else the patch
version. Version `0.0.0` means never released.

To release, run `mise run release:prepare patch|minor|major` from a clean
tree. It branches `release/vX.Y.Z` from an up-to-date `main`, bumps `version`
in `pyproject.toml`, relocks `uv.lock`, updates the version in `README.md`
and `docs/user/` install commands, commits and pushes. Then open a
`chore: release X.Y.Z` PR from that branch and merge it. Before releasing,
check that every `feat` and `fix` since the last tag is in the docs; fix any
gap in a `docs` PR first. In Claude Code, `/release-patch`, `/release-minor`
and `/release-major` do all three steps; each writes release notes into the
PR body: changes with PR links, breaking changes with migration, and the docs
check. The Release workflow runs `mise run release:publish`, which tags
`vX.Y.Z` and publishes a GitHub Release with the wheel and sdist. If that
version is already published it does nothing, so merging unrelated changes
never re-releases. If a release run fails, fix the cause and use "Run
workflow" on the Release workflow (on `main`); a tag without a published
release, or a leftover draft, is retried.

## For coding agents

Everything above applies. In addition:

- Read `CLAUDE.md` before changing code. Its gotchas each cost a debugging
  session to learn.
- Start every task on a new branch named by the convention above, created
  from an up-to-date `main`. Commit only to that branch.
- Work test-first: see the new test fail (red) for the expected reason
  before writing the fix.
- A task is done when `mise run ci` passes. Report a failure with its
  output, and say plainly which steps you skipped.
- Commit, push, open a PR, or bump the version only when asked. Open PRs as
  drafts unless told otherwise.
- Stay inside the task's scope. Note unrelated problems you find in your
  report instead of fixing them.
- When you learn something that took more than one attempt to work out, add
  it to the gotchas in `CLAUDE.md` in the same PR.
