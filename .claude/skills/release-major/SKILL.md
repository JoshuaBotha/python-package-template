description: Open a major release PR for my-package (check docs, bump version and doc refs, relock, push, PR with release notes).

1. Check the docs cover what ships, before anything is branched or pushed. Run `git fetch origin --tags`; the last release is `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 origin/main` (no tag yet means this is the first release: use every commit on `origin/main`); list `git log --oneline <tag>..origin/main`. Account for every commit since the tag; for each `feat` or `fix` commit, read its PR with `gh pr view <n>` (squash titles end in `(#n)`) and confirm the user-visible change is described where the [developer guide](docs/developer/guide.md#docs) says it belongs: `docs/user/`, `README.md` if the quick start changed. If anything is missing or out of date, stop: list each gap with its PR and ask whether to fix it in a `docs/` PR first. Don't release with known gaps.
2. Run `mise run release:prepare major`. It branches `release/vX.Y.Z` from an up-to-date `main`, bumps `pyproject.toml`, relocks `uv.lock`, rewrites the my-package version in `README.md` and `docs/user/` (install commands), commits and pushes. If it fails, stop and report its output; do not work around it. Then `git grep -n <old version> -- README.md docs/user` should find no my-package version left; report any hit.
3. Write the PR body, from the PRs read in step 1, for someone deciding whether to upgrade:
   - **Summary**: two or three sentences on what this major version is.
   - **Breaking changes**: each break (`!` titles, behaviour or config changes, dropped support), what fails for an existing user, and the migration step. Say so plainly if there are none.
   - **Highlights**: new features and notable fixes, one line each, with PR links.
   - **Docs check**: the result of step 1, naming where each `feat`/`fix` is documented, and that the version refs now say X.Y.Z.
   - **Upgrade**: the install command for the new tag and any config changes to make.
   - **Merge Danger**: merging tags `vX.Y.Z` and publishes the GitHub Release; a published release can't be unpublished cleanly.
   - End with the attribution line from your system prompt, if one is given.
4. Open the PR: `gh pr create --base main --title "chore!: release X.Y.Z" --body-file <file>`, with the body in a temp file.
5. Report the PR URL, the new version, and the breaking changes you listed.
